Consider the Devye model for the specific heat of a crystal as discussed 
in the lecture.

\paragraph{a) \textit{Corrections to classical limit:} In the lecture it was 
    shown that the Debye model yields $E=3Nk_BT$ in the classical limit as 
    expected. Calculate the first two corrections from a Taylor expansion in 
    $T_D/T$ of the integrand of the energy formula and discuss the 
    resulting heat capacity. (\textit{4 points})

    \begin{equation}
        c_v(T)
        =\frac{9Nk_B}{u^3_m}\cdot\int_0^{u_m}\frac{e^uu^4}{(e^u-1)^2}\cdot\dd u
    \end{equation}

\paragraph{b) \textit{Number of phonons:} Write the mean number of phonons 
    $\langle N\rangle$ in the Debye model as an integral (similar but 
    different to the integral formula for the energy) and evaluate it for low 
    and high temperatures. (\textit{4 points})
