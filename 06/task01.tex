In the lecture, the force-length relation of a 1D polymer was calculated
using the microcanonical ensemble.

\paragraph{a) Now do the calculation in the canonical ensemble.
    (\textit{2 points}) \\
    HINT: Consider again a chain of $N$ monomers of size $a$ with $x_i=+a$ or 
    $-a$ and $X=\sum_ix_i$ the total length of the polymer (for the given 
    configuration). Note that the polymer is "ideal", i.e. the distribution of 
    bonds does not change the energy of the chain in the force-free case;
    in turn, under an external force $F$ the energy of this system is given by 
    $E=-FX$.

\paragraph{b) Show that your result is identical to the one in the lecture.
    Discuss the limits $Fa<<k_BT$ and $Fa>>k_BT$. (\textit{2 points})
