Consider a zipper consisting of $N$ units. Each unit can either be in the 
closed state with energy 0 or in the open state with energy $\varepsilon>0$.
The zipper can open only from the left, that is, a given unit can only switch
to the open state when all units to its left are already open.

    Definition of partition sum:
    \begin{equation}
        Z=\sum_0^N\Omega_i\exp(-\beta E_i)
        \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \textnormal{with }
        \beta:=\frac{1}{k_BT}
    \end{equation}
    For each number $i$ of open bonds, there is only a single possible state 
    (due to the fact that a given unit can only switch to the open state if 
    all units to its left are open), thus $\Omega_i=1$. The energy of a given 
    state with $i$ open bonds is given by $E_i=\varepsilon\cdot i$. The 
    partition sum can then be written as
    \begin{equation}
        Z=\sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\beta E_i)
    \end{equation}

\paragraph{b) Determine the average number of open units. Discuss the limit 
    $\beta_\varepsilon>>1$. \textit{(2 points)}} \ \\

    ...
    \begin{equation}
        \langle N\rangle 
        =\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{N\cdot\exp(-\beta E_i)}{Z}
    \end{equation}
