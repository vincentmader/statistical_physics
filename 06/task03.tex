Consider a zipper consisting of $N$ units. Each unit can either be in the 
closed state with energy 0 or in the open state with energy $\varepsilon>0$.
The zipper can open only from the left, that is, a given unit can only switch
to the open state when all units to its left are already open.

\paragraph{a) Calculate the canonical partition sum. \textit{(1 point)}} \ \\
    \\
    Recall the definition of the partition sum:
    \begin{equation}
        Z=\sum_i e^{-\beta E_i}
        \,, \ \ \ \ \ \ \textnormal{with }
        \beta:=\frac{1}{k_BT} \,.
    \end{equation}
    For each configuration $i$, there is only one possible state 
    (due to the fact that a given unit can only switch to the open state if 
    all units to its left are open). The energy of a given configuration
    with $i$ open bonds is given by $E_i=\varepsilon\cdot i$. The 
    partition sum can then be written as
    \begin{equation}
        Z=1+e^{-\beta\varepsilon}+e^{-2\beta\varepsilon}+... 
        = \sum_{i=0}^N e^{-i\beta\varepsilon} 
        = \frac{e^{-(N+1)\beta\varepsilon} - 1}{e^{-\beta\varepsilon} - 1} \,.
    \end{equation}
    Starting with the configuration were all units are closed and sum up until all units
    are open.

\paragraph{b) Determine the average number of open units. Discuss the limit 
    $\beta\varepsilon>>1$. \textit{(2 points)}} \ \\
    \\
    The average number of open units is given by
    \begin{align}
        \langle n\rangle 
        &=\frac{1\cdot 0+e^{-\beta\varepsilon}\cdot 1+e^{-2\beta\varepsilon}\cdot 2+...}{Z}
        =\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{i=0}^N i e^{-i\beta\varepsilon}
        = -\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \partial_{\beta} \ln Z \\
        &= \frac{N+1}{1-e^{(N+1)\beta\varepsilon}} - \frac{1}{1-e^{\beta\varepsilon}} \,.
    \end{align}
    For $\beta\varepsilon>>1$, we get $\langle n\rangle \approx 0$ which means that the 
    zipper closes for small temperatures.
