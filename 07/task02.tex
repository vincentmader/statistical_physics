Consider a molecule, such as carbon monoxide, which consists of two 
different atoms, one carbon and one oxygen, separated by a distance $d$. 
Such a molecule can exist in quantum states of different orbital angular 
momentum. Each state has the energy
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon_l=\frac{\hbar^2}{2I}\cdot l(l+1)
\end{equation}
where $I=\mu d^2$ is the moment of inertia of the molecule about an axis 
through its centre of mass and $\mu$ is the reduced mass defined by 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\mu}=\frac{1}{m_1}+\frac{1}{m_2}
\end{equation}
$l=0,1,2,...$ is the quantum number associated with the orbital angular 
momentum. Each energy level of the rotating molecule has the degeneracy
\begin{equation}
    g_l=2l+1
\end{equation}
