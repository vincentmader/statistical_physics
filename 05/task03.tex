Assume that we know the fundamental equation as 
\begin{equation}
    E=E(S,V,N) 
\end{equation}
for some well-behaved system of interest (i.e. at least $C^2$). Then it should 
not matter in which sequence we take the partial derivatives for a second 
derivative like $\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial S\partial V}$.

\subsection{Derive the Maxwell relation}
    We introduce the notation $\partial_x:=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$
    \begin{align}
        \frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial S\partial V}
        &=\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial V\partial S} \\
        \partial_S\partial_V E &=\partial_V\partial_S E \\
        % \frac{\partial}{\partial S}\frac{\partial E}{\partial V}
        % &=
        % \frac{\partial}{\partial V}\frac{\partial E}{\partial S} \\
        -\partial_S p\ \bigg|_{V,N} &= \partial_V T\ \bigg|_{S,N} 
    \end{align}
    For this, we used the fact that
    \begin{equation}
        \partial_S E\ \bigg|_{V,N}=T
        \ \ \ \ \ \ \textnormal{and}\ \ \ \ \ \
        \partial_V E\ \bigg|_{S,N}=-p
    \end{equation}
    which can easiliy be verified using the fundamental equation:
    \begin{equation}
        dE=T\cdot dS-p\cdot dV+\mu\cdot dN
    \end{equation}
    There are three Maxwell relations, one for each of the energy terms.

\subsection{Confirm Maxwell relation explicitly for the ideal gas}
    The entropy of the ideal gas is given by (from the lecture)
    \begin{equation}
        S=k_BN\bigg\{\bigg[\bigg(\frac{V}{N}\bigg)\cdot
        \bigg(\frac{4\pi mE}{3h^2N}\bigg)^{3/2}\bigg]+\frac{5}{2}\bigg\}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item invert to get $E$
        \item then differentiate once by $V$, once by $S$
        \item compare
    \end{itemize}
