An ultra-relativistic ideal Fermi fluid is contained in a 
volume $V$. The chemical potential is $\mu$. Consider only 
the special case $T=0$ in the following. Calculate the mean 
particle number ⟨N⟩ and the mean total energy ⟨E⟩. 
Express ⟨E⟩ in terms of ⟨N⟩ and µ. \\

HINT: Ultra-relativistic means that you can neglect the mass 
term in the relativistic formula for the energy of the 
particles:
\begin{equation}
    \varepsilon(\vec p)=\sqrt{m^2c^4+\vec p^2c^2}\approx pc
\end{equation}
