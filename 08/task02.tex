Consider a system of spin $1/2$ fermions at temperature $T$, 
that occupy a finite number $M$ of energy levels 
$\varepsilon_i$ with $i=1,2,...,M$.


\paragraph{
    a) Determine the grand canonical partition sum $Z_G$.
    \textit{(1 point)}
} \ \\
    \\
    HINT: Pay attention to the degeneracy.

\paragraph{
    b) Use the relation $F=-k_BT\ln Z_G+\mu⟨N⟩$
    between the free energy, the grand canonical partition 
    sum, the chemical potential and the mean particle number 
    to show: the thermodynamic properties of the system stay 
    the same if on, instead of considering the 
    ⟨N⟩ particles, distributes $2M-⟨N⟩$ 
    "holes" with chemical potential.
