Consider a one-dimensional lattice model for a 
non-ideal gas with $N$ lattice sites and 
periodic boundary conditions. Each lattice 
site $i$ is either empty (occupancy $n_i=0$) 
or occupied by at most one atom (occupancy 
$n_i=1$). There is an attractive energy $J$ 
between atoms occupying neighbouring sites.
The chemical potential of the atoms is $\mu$. 
The Hamiltonian of this lattice gas is
\begin{equation}
    H=-J\cdot\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}n_in_j
    -\mu\cdot\sum_in_i
\end{equation}
where $\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}$ is the sum 
over all pairs of neighbouring sites.

\paragraph{1. Express the partition sum of the 
    one-dimensional lattice gas in terms of 
    the transfer matrix $T$.  Calculate the 
    transfer matrix $T$ and its eigenvalues.

\paragraph{2. Find a transformation of the 
    occupancies $n_i$ to map the lattice gas 
    model to the Ising model with spins $S_i$.

\paragraph{3. Derive an expression for the 
    average $\langle n_i\rangle$ in the limit 
    of $N\to\infty$ in terms of the 
    eigenvalues of the transfer matrix.
